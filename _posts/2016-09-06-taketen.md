Since they [launched](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11395806/facebook-messenger-bot-platform-announced-f8-conference "bot platform launch") a whole platform in April, Facebook has fostered enthusiasm around these automated assistants. They see a future where you get all your news alerts, buy flowers, make dinner reservations and plan entire trips through a message window on facebook.com.

So over the weekend I took a stab at making [my own Facebook bot](https://m.me/taketenbot "Take 10 bot"). Unlike most others, it aims to get you *off* Facebook--in that vein it may be the first anti-social Messenger bot. It follows a simple flow:

- Tell it for how long you wanna procrastinate
  - It's gotta be under 10 minutes
- After that amount of time, it'll suggest you get back to work
- It'll continue yelling at you as long as you keep reading the messages it sends (because you're clearly still on Facebook procrastinating)
- It knows a slacker from a hard worker. So when you return to Facebook later it'll prompt you for a new procrastination duration.

I have two `.js` files that convert between words and numbers. Initially, I wrote `duration.js` in a JSFiddle. I've cleaned it up a bit since, but you can play around with the word parsing here:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/lamuchacho/a99ezgfv/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It's simple--I imagine that making a talking-averse bot is far simpler than the alternative. Facebook makes it incredibly easy incorporate with messenger, and [this guide by Jerry Wang](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/have-15-minutes-create-your-own-facebook-messenger-bot-481a7db54892#.xxj1uv5hi "Jerry Wang tutorial") provided much of the connection logic.

I made the project open source, so you can view [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/zchr/taketen "GitHub code").

## TL;DR
When you're not ordering flowers and stopping crime with other Messenger bots, I hope that Take 10 keeps you productive.
