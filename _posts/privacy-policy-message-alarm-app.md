# Privacy Policy - Message Alarm App
I (Zach Schnell) made this app, so I guess that means I own it. I'm offering the app for free for iOS. 

 * No data leaves the phone on my accord. The two pieces of information that the app uses (conversation names and reminder times) are stored in UserDefault on the device. 
 * Unless Apple is doing some sort of crash analysis, I'm not collecting analytics
 * You have all the rights. Feel free to delete the app--I'll have no idea if/when you do
 
This policy is effective now (2020-11-12).
