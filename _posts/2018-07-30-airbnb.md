I just finished traveling and had the best time at my Airbnb. To stay in the traveling mindset, I threw together this Chrome extension, which presents info on a random Airbnb listing when you open a new tab.

I hope that this can both inspire guests like me to plan a future trip, as well as help hosts promote their listings. I created a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLQaP_K-lqK4hUx1hpBIWJCbRP6Dw71RmYJY_URAJTHim-BQ/viewform) to submit listings, which I will add on a rolling basis.

## Future features
 - [x] Link to submit other listings
 - [ ] Keep track of places you've been and places you want to go
  - [ ] Offer a map view for that list
 - [ ] Add in flight data
 - [ ] Add in driving data if it's within a certain distance (slash in the same country--can't drive across water yet)
 - [ ] View previous listings
 - [ ] Other browsers?
